# Matrix Multiplication Visualizer

This is a QB64 visualization of matrix multiplication.  This is inspired by 3blue1brown's animation of matrix multiplication in his [essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE) series.  The program works by selecting where the basis vectors (1,0) (i-hat) and (0,1) (j-hat) get transformed to and picking a sample vector to watch transform.  Instructions for how to use the program can be found by selecting the relevant number on the main menu of the program.

This repository contains a .bas file of the actual code along with a .txt version of the same code to view easier.  This code can be edited and compiled in the IDE provided by [the official QB64 website](https://qb64.org/).  An executable file for the program can be downloaded from the releases for the repository.
